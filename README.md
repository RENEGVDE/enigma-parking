Problem Description

The company Sioux wants to implement an innovative and automatic parking system, since their parking area has a limited number of spots. A part of the parking spots are reserved for the employees, the company wants to redirect visitors to an alternative parking area when all the parking spots in the main area are taken. Alongside this they also want to send a text message to the visitor with instructions where to park their car, when the camera on the parking lot detects the license plate. Hence, the visitors should be assigned to license plates beforehand by an administrator.

Problem Solution

Our group, Enigma plans to develop a software solution that would fully cover all the aspects of the Clients problem. The application should have an interface for the administrator to be able to manage the clients list and the cars assigned to them and also assign new clients.
There should also be a backend part of the application that would use hardware (CTV Camera) to retrieve and then identify the number on each cars plate. Moreover, it will be responsible for the logic behind the whole parking system that directs the driver to the free/available parking spots in the appropriate parking area.
